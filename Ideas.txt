1. enlarge NN(probably underfitting)(not very effective)
2. train against another model
3. change inputs to binary with larger inputs
4. add player to inputs(p1/p2)
5. reward for finishing faster/lasting longer
6. change reward rates
7. change the gamma?
8. randomize starts
9. rotations
10. Use Convolutional Neural Networks
11. Generations of models
